      <p>
      In the world of the information worker, you will handle information that is probably stored across different software suites, like SharePoint, Salesforce, Excel file, Access database, â€¦ Typically, you would like your end-users to be able to browse and/or modify this data in a general user-friendly, and preferably mobile, way. Microsoft Power Apps allows people, without any development skills, to build applications that are mobile-friendly on top of their data. Allowing other people to use the built application to browse the data and maybe even modify it.
